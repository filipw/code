It's been causing a buzz around the tech world for years, but what exactly is it? And why is it being hailed as the future of computing?</p><p id="iie9dv_104">In this book, we will delve into the world of quantum computing and explore its advantages over classical computing. We will uncover the secrets of qubits, quantum states, and quantum gates, and how they work together to create a powerful computing platform.</p><p id="iie9dv_105">But first, let's understand the basic structure of a quantum computation. In classical computing, we have bits - a value of 0 or 1. In quantum computing, we have qubits, which also have a value of 0 or 1 when read. However, unlike classical bits, we cannot write the value of a qubit in a state. A qubit is only one dimension of a quantum state, and when we collapse the state, we measure the values of all the qubits to get an outcome.</p><p id="iie9dv_106">This brings us to the first advantage of quantum computing - the ability to manipulate probabilities. Each outcome in a quantum state has a probability, and by using instructions, we can manipulate the likelihood of certain outcomes. This is where the power of quantum computing lies - in its ability to process multiple probabilities simultaneously.</p><p id="iie9dv_107">But how does this compare to classical computing? Well, in classical computing, we can only read outcomes by measuring, and if we want to infer probabilities, we have to repeat the computation many times. However, in quantum computing, we can truly sample from the probability distribution that the computation builds, giving us a big advantage in certain problems.</p><p id="iie9dv_108">One such problem is factoring large numbers, which is where quantum computing truly shines. Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm for factoring, is a prime example of how quantum computing can solve problems that are practically impossible for classical computers.</p><p id="iie9dv_109">But it's not just about solving problems that classical computers struggle with. Quantum computing also offers a new way of thinking about computation. The butterfly structure, a key component of quantum computing, allows for parallelism - the ability to process multiple pairs of values simultaneously. This is a game-changer for problems that follow this pairing pattern, such as matrix decomposition, neural networks, and even accounting.</p><p id="iie9dv_110">However, it's important to note that quantum computing is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It is specialized computing, and it's crucial to understand when and where it can be used effectively. Becoming quantum ready involves understanding the structure of quantum computing and identifying problems that can take advantage of its unique capabilities.</p><p id="iie9dv_111">In this book, we will also explore the steps towards building quantum platforms and implementing quantum algorithms and solutions. From efficient sampling from complex distributions to solving optimization problems, quantum computing offers a whole new world of possibilities.</p><p id="iie9dv_112">So, what is special about quantum computing? Its ability to manipulate probabilities, process multiple pairs of values simultaneously, and solve problems that classical computers struggle with. It's a new way of thinking about computation, and it's here to revolutionize the world of technology.</p><div class="last-modified">Last modified: 05 April 2024</div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom"><a href="about.html" class="navigation-links__prev">Building Quantum Software: A Developer's Guide</a><a href="marketing.html" class="navigation-links__next">Book Marketing</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/writerside/apidoc/6.6.6-b224/app.js"></script></body></html>
